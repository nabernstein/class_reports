# Class Reports
### A collection of reports I completed for coursework during my BA Applied Mathematics and BS Computer Science

[Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition (June 2018)](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/Baroni_Bernstein_SVD.pdf)  
The explaination of a concept of Linear Algebra and it's importance to the field of Computer Science written to be understood by a freshman Computer Science major so that they pay attention in math class.

[On the Motion of Ponytails (December 2018)](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/On_The_Motion_of_Ponytails.pdf)  
The discussion of a simplified mathematical model of the physical mechanics involved with the ponytails of long-haired runners to explain why a ponytail moves side to side while the runner's head only moves up and down. 

[On the Runge-Kutta Method (December 2018)](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/Math340_RKF45.pdf)
A brief explanation and implementation of the differential equation approximation algorithm known as 4th Order Runge-Kutta.

[Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Assistants (April 2019) ](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/Google_Duplex.pdf)  
A short exploration of the ethics involved with the advancement of virtual assistants such as Google Duplex.  

[Card++ Written Requirements (May 2019)](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/C_Written%20Requirements%20Cardpp.pdf)  
Software documentation for group project: Card++, a card counting training program.

[Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Assistants (April 2019) ](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/Google_Duplex.pdf)  
A short discussion on the ethics involved with the advancement of virtual assistants such as Google Duplex.  

[Space Invaders with Deep Q Learning (December 2019)](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/Space_Invaders_DQN.pdf)  
A recreation of a Google DeepMind experiment where the Deep Q Learning machine learning algorithm was applied to create an agent that could learn to play Atari Space Invaders.

[Python vs. MATLAB and RKMO4 vs. ode45](https://github.com/nabernstein/class_reports/blob/master/python_v_matlab.pdf)  
A short experiment where the computational speed and accuracy of Python is compared to MATLAB as well as comparisons between my Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method and the ordinary differential equation solvers that come with MATLAB and the SciPy libray.
